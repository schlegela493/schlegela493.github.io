        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 350F (177C) and prepare two deep 8" round cake pans by lining the bottoms with parchment paper and lightly greasing the sides. Set aside.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large bowl using an electric mixer) cream together the butter, canola oil and sugar until creamy and well-combined.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Stir in vanilla extract.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Using a spatula and gently hand-mixing, alternate adding flour mixture and buttermilk to the butter mixture, starting and ending with flour mixture and mixing until just combined after each addition.  The batter should be smooth and completely combined, but avoid over-mixing.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Evenly divide batter into your prepared cake pans, and bake on 350F (175C) for 30-35 minutes.  When the cake is done, the surface should spring back to the touch and a toothpick inserted in the center should come out mostly clean with few moist crumbs (no wet batter).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Allow cakes to cool in their cake pans for 10-15 minutes before inverting onto cooling rack to cool <strong>completely</strong> before frosting.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Frost cake and decorate with sprinkles (if desired).</p>

        <h2><strong>Shortcake</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Start by preparing your strawberries. Place sliced strawberries in a medium sized bowl and add 3 tablespoons of sugar. Stir well and set aside so they can get nice and juicy while you prepare your shortcakes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Preheat oven to 425F (220C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>In a large bowl combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt and whisk to combine.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Use a box grater to grate cold butter into the dry ingredients. Stir until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add heavy cream and milk and use a spoon or spatula to stir until ingredients are combined. Don't over-work the dough, but stir until it begins to cling together.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Transfer shortcake dough to a floured surface and work the dough together with your hands, adding more flour as needed if the dough is sticky.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong>Once the dough is a cohesive ball, fold it in half over itself and use your hands to gently flatten the layers. Rotate dough 90 degrees, then fold in half again. Repeat this step 5-6 times, taking care to not overwork the dough.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong>Using your hands, gently flatten the dough to 1" thick. Lightly dust a 2 3/4" round biscuit cutter³¾ with flour, and press the biscuit cutter straight down (don't twist) to cut out shortcakes. Place shortcakes on prepared baking sheet, less than 1/2" apart.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong>Once you have cut as many shortcakes as possible out of the dough, gently re-work the dough to get out another shortcake or two until you have at least 6 .Brush with additional heavy cream and sprinkle generously with coarse sugar (if you don't have coarse sugar, regular granulated will also work just fine).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong>Bake on 425F (220C) for 14-15 minutes or until tops and bottoms of shortcakes are beginning to just turn lightly golden brown.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 10:</strong>Prepare whipped cream while shortcakes cool.</p>
        <h2><strong>Whipped Cream</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Step 11:</strong>Combine heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl (if you chilled a bowl before starting, use that now).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 12:</strong>Using an electric mixer, beat ingredients on low speed, gradually increasing speed to high, and beat until stiff peaks form. Don't over-beat, but don't stop beating until cream has reached a billowy Cool-Whip consistency.</p>
        <h2><strong>Shortcake Assembly</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Step 13:</strong>Slice cooled shortcakes in half and place the bottom half cut-side up on a plate.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 14:</strong>Stir your strawberries once more (they should be nice and juicy by now) and top one shortcake half generously with your prepared strawberries, and then with a dollop of homemade whipped cream.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 15:</strong>Top the whipped cream with the top half of your shortcake, and then top with additional whipped cream and finally additional strawberries. Serve immediately after assembling.</p>
